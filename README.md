# 🎮 IOT Arduino Game Controller Java ☕️
🎮 A **Game controller** realized with an **Arduino**, I modified the **Arduino** bootloader to program with **Java** ☕️

Don't get me wrong, I can easily program this in standard C too, but I like the aspects of **OOP (object-oriented programming)**. 
That's the reason why I mostly prefer **Java** / C++ over ANSI C.
